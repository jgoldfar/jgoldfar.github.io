<h3>Inverse Problems for Equations of Mathematical Physics</h3>
In many applications, the relevant parameters for the solution of the PDE are not available, or involve some measurement error: in this case, one must first solve a PDE <em>Inverse problem</em> to identify the relevant parameters.
After first solving this problem, useful predictions may be made.
I study the the development of numerical methods for the solution of these problems, as well as rigorous treatment of convergence, differentiability, and other aspects of inverse problems for a class of parabolic equations describing phenomena such as diffusion of a gas or heat in a medium.
