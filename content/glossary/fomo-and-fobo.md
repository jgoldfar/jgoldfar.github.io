The terms "FOMO" and "FOBO" are common parlance in some groups - not everyone is familiar with both terms, and how some individuals in roles such as sales use FOMO or FOBO to try to influence prospective buyers. Both are fear-based factors, fundamentally - research in economics seems to suggest that some significant percentage of buyer choice is actually emotional rather than rational, so companies wanting to maximize conversion are bound to use powerful emotions like fear to try to land a sale.

- A statement like "only 3 more at this price!" may trigger Fear of Missing Out (FOMO). FOMO tends to increase likelihood to commit.
- Fear of Better Options (FOBO) tends to increase hesitancy or indecision - a buyer may tell themselves "I have 20 options, and they all seem great - if I wait, I'll find out what makes one stand out".

Recognizing either impulse can bring people insights - this has been [written](https://patrickmcginnis.com/blog/meet-fobo-the-evil-brother-of-fomo-that-can-ruin-your-life/) [about](https://www.inverse.com/innovation/how-to-overcome-fomo-fobo-decision-making) [extensively](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/30/smarter-living/how-to-beat-fobo-from-the-expert-who-coined-it.html): I know I'm not breaking new ground here, just doing my part to raise awareness about concepts I find useful.
