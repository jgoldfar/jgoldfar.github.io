A glossary is a listing of definitions, concepts, jargon, and other terms. It serves as a mapping between high-order concepts and their simpler counterparts.

In my years of experience in education, I have found that one of the hardest things to get right - both in mind of the student and the teacher - is the correct definitions and concepts. Once you have those, oftentimes statements of fact - like theorems - become easier to form and comprehend. Then, paraphrasing an idea from mathematics, once we have statements of fact, we find the reasoning easily enough.

The purpose of this glossary is to provide a place to record and discuss terms of interest.
