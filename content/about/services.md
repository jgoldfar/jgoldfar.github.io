In the projects I have collaborated on, I tackled poorly defined challenges and created a body of work for understanding their solutions together with skilled colleagues. We delivered products that delighted stakeholders for projects at small and large scales, whether measured in terms of person-year investment or LoC. I found joy in being able to talk with creative people and domain experts about their problems, and contributing to their growth where I can provide value. If anything, the limited amount of time in the day can be a great frustration, when there so many ways to have a positive impact on the world.

If you are a reader of my weblog, you may know that I have been developing systems and products collaboratively and semi-professionally for a decade or more. I am starting to bring the professional services I can offer across the product development life-cycle to the "modern" web, with a [gig on Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/share/EEYo7Y). I'll be adding more gigs and details as I better understand the marketplace. Creating a service description that fits Fiverr's formatting requirements can be challenging, so clarification is likely needed. I welcome feedback and criticism of any kind.
