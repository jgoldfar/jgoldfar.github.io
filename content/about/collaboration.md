I define collaboration as inclusive, results-driven partnerships built around common goals; in my work, I prioritize connection and communication to unlock the insights necessary to increase efficiency and deliver operational benefits.
In a rapidly changing environment, the only way to successfully adapt is to accept more opinions, more perspectives, and finally more action - I take a people-first approach to understanding your organization's vision and goals.

For many projects, technology is actually a small but critical component in the processes producing good outcomes; in my experience, a focus on actively listening to stakeholders and domain experts provides a basis for strategic discussions around adapting to changing conditions and progressing towards long-term goals.
By engaging with the challenges faced by your people, I develop a detailed understanding of the opportunities for optimization and transformation to create sustainable, impactful growth.

If you are the market for an IT professional, or even just curious about the solution to a specific technical problem, I would love to sit down and chat. We can discuss your overall IT strategy, or assess a specific component to identify areas of improvement or troubleshoot an issue.
