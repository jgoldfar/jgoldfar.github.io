As a collaborator, I believe that language and practice must go hand in hand when developing a work product; furthermore, my experience has suggested that delivering anything valuable requires more opinions, more eyes, and more perspectives, not fewer.
While developing the wide variety of skills necessary to be successful in the day-to-day business of being productive as a technical contributor, I have observed that a mindset of perpetual learning helps me to engage as a member of cross-functional teams of any size.
The opportunities afforded by membership in a diverse and inclusive team are immense - oftentimes the best ideas arise out of dialogues with colleagues of different backgrounds, priorities, and viewpoints.

> The beginning of wisdom is a definition of terms - Socrates

- I am a student of life and a believer in sharing knowledge; though I have lectured and taught in formal settings, I recognize that there is little value in asserting authority, power, or experience over the unknown - instead, I approach the development of understanding through Socratic discovery, and treat questions with curiosity and interest.

> The limits of my language means the limits of my world. - Wittgenstein

- As a lover of language and observer of communication, I recognize the power of words - and their limits. It is through dialogue that we learn about our team, the goals we should align ourselves with, and the objective reality of the world around us. I find that I communicate most effectively when I am honest, intentional, and transparent; I appreciate the negotiation of different individuals' perspectives into a cohesive position and direction. The limits of words are perhaps most interesting, since that is often where value lies. I feel that every conversation, properly approached, is an opportunity for learning.

> I know nothing except the fact of my ignorance - Socrates

- When placed in a position of leadership in an organization, I have found that my most valuable contributions arise through collaborative empowerment. Embracing my own ignorance, empowering those around me - my experience has prepared me to lead by example, and listen intently to my colleagues. I am not sure I believe in managing people; projects and products may need management, position, and direction, but people are full of opportunity and motivation, provided the right environment.

I an passionate about collaborating and delivering value: if you appreciate this perspective, or would like to learn more, [reach out!](/contact).
