> “People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.”  -- Steve Jobs

As Jobs observes, there is more to innovation than just [collaboration](./collaboration): true innovation, perhaps in the form of a Pareto improvement over the status quo, also requires deliberate focus on executing a positive vision.
I have worked with many teams over my years of work experience, and observed that innovation comes in small and large increments.
Innovation never comes without the investment of time and effort.
When conditions change rapidly, innovation can require the adoption of debt, technical or otherwise - while sustainable business practices are key to the viability of a business as a whole, a business cannot survive at all without adapting and evolving.

On cross-functional teams, I have found that ownership of my domain within organization, open and receptive communication of requirements with internal stakeholders, and advocacy for critical needs and risks have helped to continue a project's momentum.
Innovation often arises through judicious application of institutional knowledge and resources together with open-source data and tools.
Bringing diverse perspectives to the decision-making process can be essential to avoid unnecessary liabilities - constraints arising due to e.g. legal requirements or user data security can not be ignored when a product goes to market.

If you are reading this, you may be curious about what I can do for you or your team; I have done myriad varieties of work in different contexts and domains: I am comfortable with training, consulting, and freelance engagements.
I am always looking for challenging problems and people to discuss them with. [Let's connect!](/contact)
