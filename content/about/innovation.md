> “People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.”  -- Steve Jobs

As Jobs observes, there is more to innovation than just [collaboration]({{<relref "collaboration.md" >}}): as much as inclusion of diverse ideas and the facilitation of a vibrant discussion creates a strong starting point for growth, innovation also requires a deliberate focus on executing a positive vision, and evolving in response to changing conditions. In my role, I provide organization, ownership, and dedicated effort towards our defined goals and objectives.

I engage with organizations and teams to coordinate open sharing of relevant information, advocate for critical needs, risks, \& opportunities, and build out capabilities with today's technologies to create robust solutions. I believe that the proper application of technology can provide strategic business advantages, improve the bottom line, and help you stay ahead of the competition.

If you are reading this, you may be curious about what I can do for you or your team; I am always looking for challenging problems and people to discuss them with.
