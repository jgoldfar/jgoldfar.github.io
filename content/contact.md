- *2016--Present*: Working professionally in the Defense, Finance, Education, and Medical industries in roles from engineering to project management, I have discovered continuity between the experience of a research faculty member and a client-focused solution architect. Both contexts require mediating requirements from multiple stakeholders, balancing constraints, resources \& investments, and building results that delight people. See [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-goldfarb/) or [a somewhat recent resume (PDF)](/res.pdf).

    - *Key technologies*: Python, JavaScript, Linux, SQL (PostgreSQL), AWS (Lambda, RDS, EC2), Google Cloud, Apache Spark, Docker, ...

I offer a [wide variety of services](/about/services) for non-profits and businesses; in addition to clients I work with on a repeat basis, I have delivered value at all stages of organizational initiatives as a freelancer and contractor, from solution discovery to system implementation and management.
