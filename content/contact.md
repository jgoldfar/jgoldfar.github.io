- *2016--Present*: Working professionally in the Defense, Finance, Education, and Medical industries in roles from engineering to project leadership, I have discovered continuity between the experience of a research faculty member and a customer-focused solution engineer. Both contexts require meeting and mediating requirements from multiple stakeholders, managing backlogs of efforts, and deploying products that delight users.

    - *Outcomes*: Prototypes and products released to end-users, internal documentation for colleagues.

    - *Key technologies*: Python, JavaScript, Linux, SQL, AWS (Lambda, RDS, EC2), Google Cloud, Apache Spark, ...

- *2009--2016*: During this time, I completed my doctoral research on optimization and parameter identification for complex models, implemented projects in consultation with departmental and administration stakeholders, and collaborated with colleagues & faculty on their research projects. I developed experience in critical problem analysis, collaboration with subject-matter experts, and the production of efficient software for the solution of data-intensive problems through iterative refinement across the traditional software development life-cycle. I worked with cross-disciplinary teams to develop research ideas into meaningful progress in the understanding of real-world phenomena, and directed activity in a university center towards the goals of knowledge generation and sharing.

    - *Outcomes*: Multiple peer-reviewed publications in highly ranked journals, presentations and supporting collateral for joint works with colleagues.

    - *Key technologies*: Python, C++, Linux, Docker, MATLAB, Julia, ...
