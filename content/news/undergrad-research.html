Our research group is focussed on developing new theoretical and computational tools for the slution of applied problems related to the phase transition processes, image processing, and optimization.
As a part of our group, you will learn powerful mathematical techniques to attack new problems, as well as state-of-the-art tools for scientific computing and data analysis.
Students from any major are invited to come discuss research directions and topics; my research interests and work cover wide range of topics, so if you have a project or problem in mind, contact me or stop by any time.
