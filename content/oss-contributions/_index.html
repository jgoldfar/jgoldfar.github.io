As a part of my work over the years, I have been involved in one way or another in the development of various software packages.

While some things may remain closed-source or private indefinitely, at least in the scientific domain my belief is that sharing code is as essential as sharing knowledge in any other form.
I will therefore document my ongoing and previous work here; this is a work-in-progress, since the organization of these codes itself is a task!
