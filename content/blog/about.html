I am an applied mathematician with a background in partial differential equations, meteorology, and software development, among other things.
If you'd like to know more about my published work, or to contact me regarding an interesting problem or work to be done, please look to the contact information on the left.

<p>

This blog is a place for me to collect ideas and exposition on various projects I work on, or have an interest in.
It exists in part due to the confluence of two trends: lack of an outlet for prose writing, and a possibly neverending series of steps in a kind of random walk through knowledge space.
</p>

<p>
Let me explain.

<br />

As I wrote more mathematical content (including relatively full-fledged lecture notes) I noticed that my prose writing has suffered since my time as an undergraduate.
From one side, this is to be expected, since mathematical exposition is a skill like any other; it is relatively easy to give results and solved examples with some motivation, but another thing altogether to bring true insight in written form.
The latter must be practiced, and writing papers simply does not (at this stage in my career) seem to be the place to do so.

<br />

As part of that, I am going to experiment with online "office hours" or discussion; for now, please submit interesting problems or questions of a mathematical nature to my email and I will select some for posts here.

</p>

<p>
To expand a bit on this second reason, to be clear, I am no <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com">Terence Tao</a>, though I admire his work; my goal is to contribute towards human understanding of the world around us and solve interesting problems, but the journey is not straightforward.
It sometimes happens that a particular line of inquiry is not fruitful immediately, or development in another research area becomes more pressing, so the notes that I take in one direction or another aren't terribly useful.
Other times, some technical problem that arises as part of my other duties can be solved in an interesting way.
Having this space allows me to organize these thoughts, even if no-one out there reads them.

<h4>Possible topics, in no particular order</h4>
<ul>
    <li />Optimization, Optimal Control, and any other of my active research areas.
    <li />Machine Learning and Inference.
    <li />Atmospheric Dynamics and Meteorology.
    <li />Numerical Methods, in all their forms.
    <li />Mathematical/reproducible methods for automating business processes.
    <li />Education and Advocacy for the public good.
    <li />Reviews of papers and books, and explorations of selected topics.
    <li />Anything else I can think of.
</ul>
