If you're reading this post, you might be looking for some context around the blog and this section on the site.
I have a passion for experimenting with technologies and approaches, with the overall goal of delivering value to the organizations and teams I serve.
This blog is a place to work out those experiments, discuss learnings, and ask questions.

One of my goals as a communicator is to facilitate simple, clear, and effective dialogue involving complex ideas.
Oftentimes, I can't achieve that goal in a blog post - clarity can require interaction between the reader, the subject, and the environment.

The posts that I write here are often just starting points for dialogue online or offline.
To provide better context, I rely on feedback.
I'm always looking for ways to improve and help.
