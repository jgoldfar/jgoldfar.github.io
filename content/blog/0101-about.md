If you're here reading this post, you might be looking for context this section on my personal site.
What is a blog, and what is this blog?

To save you some time, I'll just tell you what you won't find: you won't always find "quality", "strong opinions weakly held", or "an identifiable theme".

I may repeat myself or I may contradict myself.

I may post original content, excerpt and critique on someone else's work, or respond to your feedback.

I may ask questions without having my own reasoned answer.

The only thru-line is me as a communicator.

As a skeptic and a humanist, I am deeply interested in the world and those I am lucky enough to share it with.
I strive to empower those around me to ask more fruitful questions, engage in effective dialogue, and achieve their goals.

So if you have something to say or need help with anything, send me a message at [jgoldfar@gmail.com](mailto:jgoldfar@gmail.com) or text me at [321-895-4184](tel:+1-321-895-4184).
