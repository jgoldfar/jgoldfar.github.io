This section of my site is a web log, a collection of writings and other combinations of images, text, and media expressed in visual form.
I subscribe to the notion that having good ideas is a matter of having lots of ideas and selecting the best among them - ideas are not worth much on their own, but in my experience, there is value in adapting the correct convex combination to challenging problems.
Luckily for everyone, most of my ideas don't end up online; from my years of experience between industry and academia, I have a growing body of raw material to draw from for essays, analyses, and other types of articles I hope to be of use.
Lately, I have been enjoying the practice of summarizing and synthesizing information from primary sources with a focus on specific themes and topics, and preparing those summaries for different audiences.

I would welcome feedback in any form, as I love hearing the opinions of individuals whose perspectives diverge from my own; as a skeptic I don't think any idea, belief, or individual is above question.
I have a disdain for jargon and artificial complexity - the world is endlessly complex as it is.
In this section, I hope to practice simple, clear, and effective communication of complex ideas starting with curiosity and intention.
In my two decades years of formal education and in even greater measure in the variety of efforts I joined after earning my doctorate, one prominent lesson I have learned is that wisdom is not to be gained through specialization, nor is it to be found by looking to any singular model of success.
Paraphrasing an embattled icon of reason, I know that I know nothing, and that this truth is likely fundamental to the human condition.

As an academic, I still see opportunities for learning, connection, and collaboration everywhere.
I am particularly interested in design patterns, creative and experimental innovation, and the people that build practices and processes.
I learned from an early age that failure is the only way to learn, and in this age of technological acceleration we must all fail faster and more often.
So with this brief introduction, please: enjoy this blog, leave a comment, and [reach out with topic suggestions or inquiries](mailto:jgoldfar@gmail.com).
