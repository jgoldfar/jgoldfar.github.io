It is an enormous challenge to evaluate candidates problem-solving ability, critical thinking, and proficiency with the tools and techniques they will need to use on the job within a reasonable timeframe - as an educator with a background is managing a team, I can see some of the reasons why [code-based interviews](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-prepare-for-your-next-senior-developer-interview-7efdc77f0593) are not uncommon.
Depending on the quality of the interviewer, a code-based interview can effectively expose some of how a candidate engages with a problem and balances scope, time, and cost of execution to achieve an outcome of a given quality.
These are important aspects a hiring manager needs to understand about their prospect, particularly for a position on a small team that needs to move quickly.

I am not the first person to [see some issues](https://medium.com/swlh/senior-devs-say-no-to-coding-assignments-b66577299b2e) with engaging beyond the friendly conversations that candidates go through develop a mutual understanding with the team.
Evaluating a candidate in an environment close to the one they will work in should give a useful signal.
Right?
