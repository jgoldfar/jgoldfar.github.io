Anyone who's tried to look back on a document from years ago probably knows how difficult it can be for anything more than the simplest files.
There are [good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_rot) [reasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy) why, over a long enough time scale, such problems are likely unavoidable (though that [doesn't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_Golden_Record) [stop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Now_Foundation) us from [trying](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/green_room/2009/11/atomic_priesthoods_thorn_landscapes_and_munchian_pictograms.html), with completely unknown results.)
