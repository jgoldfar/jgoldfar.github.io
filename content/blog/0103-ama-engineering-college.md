As an educator with 5 years as a full-time faculty member at an engineering college, I have had the pleasure of working with incredibly intelligent people of all levels of seniority.
It is a great privilege to have the opportunity to share my knowledge, work with students, and observe the learning process.
Observing - carefully and compassionately _noticing_ what a student is doing - is one of the most powerful modalities for education.

As a life-long student, I naturally continued to observe my colleagues and students as I moved up the hierarchy in higher education.
In a private institution, opacity, prejudicial assumptions and politics can obscure how capital and knowledge combine to evolve the environment.
In my opinion, transparency foments a better educational environment.

As my small contribution to transparency, I welcome any question or comment via the form below, and will post with permission any frequently asked questions here as well as responding directly.
