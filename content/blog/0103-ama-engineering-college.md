As an educator with 5 years as a full-time faculty member at an engineering college, I have had the pleasure of working with incredibly intelligent people of all levels of seniority.
It is a great privilege to have the opportunity to share my knowledge, work with students, and observe the learning process.
Observing - carefully and compassionately _noticing_ what a student is doing - is one of the most powerful modalities for education.

Some of the observations most fascinating to me are when otherwise intelligent people expose their biases and the limits of their understanding; sometimes, people revel in restricting their perspective to a specific area, but oftentimes these biases show themselves in ways that are outside of people's awareness.

As a life-long student, I naturally continued to observe my colleagues and students as I moved up the hierarchy in higher education. In a private institution, opacity and politics obscure how capital and knowledge are combined to evolve an institution. The fact is, hierarchy, prejudice, and opacity do not support education. As part of my dedication to transparency and understanding my weaknesses, I welcome any question via the form below, and will post frequently asked questions here as well as responding directly.
