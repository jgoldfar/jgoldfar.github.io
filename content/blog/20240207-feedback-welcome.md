Folks who read the posts on this blog may notice that the comment form, previously integrated via Disqus, has been removed.

For a blog such as this one, the moderation overhead far outweighed the value that those forms provided.

While I am more interested than ever in your feedback, the comment form hasn't been the best place for good feedback.

Email continues to be the best way to reach out; if you have a topic suggestion, a question, or just want to say "hey", I'm always available at [jgoldfar@gmail.com](mailto:jgoldfar@gmail.com)
