Visitors to this blog may notice that I haven't published much recently here; my recent content strategy has emphasized social media platforms and to a larger extent my internal stakeholders.

Follow the links in the top bar to see what I mean. The real value for me is in direct messages, which you won't see, but if you reach out I'll get back to you.

I am somewhat active on LinkedIn and have great engagement with folks in the industry.

You can expect occasional audio/visual content on Instagram.

For reasons, I put very little into X/Twitter, leaving me nowhere to park the industrial-grade nonsense I sometimes conceive.

If anything about that interests you, feel free to follow me.
Am I missing something? Let me know!

To get in touch for help understanding your challenge, or simply have something to say to me, the best way is to send me a message at [jgoldfar@gmail.com](mailto:jgoldfar@gmail.com) or call at [321-895-4184](tel:+1-321-895-4184).
