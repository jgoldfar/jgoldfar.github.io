There's a reason why a dissertation is considered an achievement in one's life: producing such a document is a crazy thing to do, and it shows the kind of dedication you can put into a project.
I certainly believe the topic I spent those years of my life studying was worthwhile, and I put a high (moral?) value on the advancement of human understanding of the world through the scientific process.
On the other hand, as a parent, I've seen my kids be fascinated just as deeply (in a developmentally appropriate way, to be sure) by topics most would consider quite mundane.
So I have some understanding what it must look like to someone in a different field, much less anyone outside of academia.
After all, for most of my life so far, I too had no PhD.

In this post, I'm going to discuss my PhD journey and topic in an informal way, and why I believe that nearly anyone _could_ come to the same achievement in the field of their choice.
