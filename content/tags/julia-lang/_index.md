[Julia](https://julialang.org/) is a dynamic, optionally typed, high-performance, [open-source]({{< ref "/posts/why-oss.md" >}}) programming language.

While initially devised as a language and runtime for scientific computing a-la MATLAB, it promises to be the ultimate prototyping-to-production language: performance akin to a traditional compiled language, but with programming productivity (enabled by the flexible, expressive, and dynamic nature of the language itself) akin to Python or R.
Julia is an excellent "glue" language, enabling the utilization of codes written in anything from C and C++ to Python and R in a coherent way.

<!-- A few of my [open source contributions](/oss-contributions) and research codes are available in Julia. -->
