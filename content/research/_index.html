My current research is focussed on elaborating aspects of the analysis of Partial Differential Equations (PDE), but I am always looking for new problems in applications ranging from scientific computing to data science.
Partial differential equations come from many applications; practically any problem of physics requires the solution of a properly posed PDE problem; PDE represent a kind of structural condition on how an unknown function may change shape, with even simple such conditions giving sometimes surprising results.
The research I am currently pursuing falls into the following categories
<ul>
<li>Inverse problems for Equations of Mathematical Physics
<li>Nonlinear Degenerate Parabolic Equations and Development of Interfaces
</ul>
