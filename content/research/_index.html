My current research is in various aspects of the analysis of Partial Differential Equations (PDE) and related problems. Partial differential equations come from many applications; practically any problem of physics requires the solution of a properly posed PDE problem. Though I have a wide interest, the research I am currently pursuing falls into the following categories
<ul>
<li>Inverse problems for Equations of Mathematical Physics
<li>Nonlinear Degenerate Parabolic Equations and Development of Interfaces
</ul>
