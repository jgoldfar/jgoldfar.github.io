<h3 id="motivating-example">Motivating Example</h3>
<p>Consider a curve such as that defining a unit circle in the plane,
    <span class="math display">
        \[x^{2} + y^{2}=1\]
    </span> Note that this definition is a special case of a more general situation, a curve defined as a level set of a function
    <span class="math display">
        \[f(x,y):=
        x^{2} + y^{2}= 1
        =:z_{0}\]
    </span>
    Since this is a relatively simple curve, we can draw it and observe that, while it is not a function with respect to either <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> (that is, in general we cannot solve the equation for either <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, respectively), in a small neighborhood of any point (signified by a dashed circle in Figure <a href="#fig:locally-explicit-circle" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:locally-explicit-circle">1</a> about the given point) the curve is indeed a function, as we can see:</p>

    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    When is it <em>not</em> possible to solve this equation locally for, say, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>? Evidently, the issue arises in any neighborhood of <span class="math inline">\((1,0)\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\((-1,0)\)</span>, where the slope of the tangent line with respect to the <em>other</em> variable is undefined. This is a bit hard to quantify and/or generalize to more than 2 dimensions, but it is equivalent to check that <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial{} f}{\partial{} y} \neq 0\)</span>.
</p>
<p>Now, most of the time, we have no idea how an implicit function looks: how does the graph of
    <span class="math display">
        \[\tan(y) - y = x + e^{x}\]
    </span>
    look? Where can it be solved for <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> in some sense? Evidently, we won’t be able to write down a representation <span class="math inline">\(y=f(x)\)</span> in an explicit closed form, but the notion of a closed form solution itself depends on the set of functions one considers to be elementary, so this isn’t a particularly useful criterion anyways. The existence of such a representation, even if we can’t find it in closed form, is still useful: indeed, this is exactly the trick used in the implicit differentiation technique commonly used in freshman-level Calculus courses.</p>
<p>Note that the previous equation can be written in the implicit form
    <span class="math display">
        \[F(x,y) := \tan(y) - y - x - e^x \equiv 0\]
    </span>
    and if an explicit representation <span class="math inline">\(y=f(x)\)</span> existed, it must satisfy <span class="math inline">\(F(x,f(x))=0\)</span>. Implicit function theorem offers a way to prove that such a representation exists under certain conditions.</p>
<h3 id="statement-of-implicit-function-theorem">Statement of Implicit Function Theorem</h3>
<p>Implicit function theorem can be found in many references; we will use that from <span class="citation" data-cites="evans98">(Evans 1998, vol. 19, sec. C.5.7)</span>. Fix any <span class="math inline">\(n,m \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}\)</span>. We will consider points in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^{n+m}\)</span> as pairs of points in the Cartesian product
    <span class="math display">
        \[\mathbb{R}^{n}\times \mathbb{R}^{m} = \left\{(x,y):~x=(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}) \in \mathbb{R}^{n},~
        y=(y_{1},\ldots,y_{m})\right\}\]
    </span>
</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(U\subset \R^{n+m}\)</span> be open and <span class="math inline">\(f:U \to \R^{m}\)</span> be a <span class="math inline">\(C^{1}\)</span> map. That is, <span class="math inline">\(f \in C^{1}(U; \R^{m})\)</span>. Denote the components of <span class="math inline">\(f(x,y) \in \R^{m}\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(f^{1},\ldots,f^{m}\)</span>. Fix any <span class="math inline">\(\big(x_{0}, y_{0}\big) \in U\)</span> and set <span class="math inline">\(z_{0} = f(x_{0}, y_{0})\)</span>. Suppose that
    <span class="math display">
        \[\text{det}(\nabla_{y} f)
        = \begin{vmatrix}
        f_{y_{1}}^{1} &amp; \cdots &amp; f_{y_{m}}^{1}
        \\
        &amp; \ddots &amp;
        \\
        f_{y_{1}}^{m} &amp; \cdots &amp; f_{y_{m}}^{m}
        \end{vmatrix}
        \neq 0\]
    </span>
    Then there is an open set <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(U \supset V \ni (x_{0}, y_{0})\)</span>, an open set <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\R^{n} \supset W \ni x_{0}\)</span> and a function <span class="math inline">\(g \in C^{1}(W;\R^{m})\)</span> such that
    <span class="math display">
        \[g(x_{0}) = y_{0}
        ~\text{and}~
        f(x, g(x)) = z_{0}~\text{for}~x \in W\]
    </span>
    <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is unique, in that if <span class="math inline">\((x,y) \in V\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f(x,y) = z_{0}\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(y=g(x)\)</span>. Moreover, increasing the regularity of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> increases the regularity of <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="application-and-extension">Application and Extension</h3>
<p>Consider the implicit form for the equation defining a unit circle,
    <span class="math display">
        \[F(x,y) := x^2 + y^2 - 1 \equiv 0\]
    </span>
</p>
<p>We calculate
    <span class="math display">
        \[\nabla_y F = F_y = 2y\]
    </span>
    and hence <span class="math inline">\(\text{det} (\nabla_y F) = 0\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(y \neq 0\)</span>; that is, the implicit function has an explicit form for <span class="math inline">\(y \neq 0\)</span>. Revisiting Figure <a href="#fig:locally-explicit-circle" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:locally-explicit-circle">1</a>, we see that this makes perfect sense: anywhere <span class="math inline">\(y=0\)</span>, the graph is locally vertical. The set <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> of the implicit function theorem can be identified with, for example, the interior of the dashed circle in Figure <a href="#fig:locally-explicit-circle" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:locally-explicit-circle">1</a>, and its projection to the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis with the set <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> of the implicit function theorem.</p>
<p>In freshman-level Calculus courses, we typically use implicit function theorem to give a justification for implicit differentiation; recall that we can use chain rule as a kind of change of variables rule:
    <span class="math display">
        \[\dD{f}{x} = \dD{f}{y}\dD{y}{x}\]
    </span>
    which we use to differentiate a (perhaps complicated) implicit function of the form <span class="math inline">\(F(x,y)=0\)</span>. From one side, we could use multivariable Calculus to complete this task, since it follows that
    <span class="math display">
        \[0 = \D{}{x}F(x,y) = F_x + F_y y&#39;\]
    </span>
    so
    <span class="math display">
        \[y&#39; = \frac{-F_x}{F_y}\]
    </span>
    Note that this is exactly why we don’t encourage students to think of differentials as quotients, since the above formula would read
    <span class="math display">
        \[\dD{y}{x} = - \D{F}{x} \Big/ \D{F}{y}\]
    </span>
    That is, cancellation does <em>not</em> work with all differentials, so learning it as a rule would be a mistake.</p>
<p>If multivariable Calculus is not available, we actually have to use implicit function theorem “behind the scenes”, even though the prerequisites for the result include multivariable calculus!
    Given an implicit function <span class="math inline">\(F(x,y) = 0\)</span>, we know that we can “solve” this equation for <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> in a neighborhood <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> of a solution <span class="math inline">\((x_0,y_0)\)</span> to get a differentiable representation <span class="math inline">\(y=g(x)\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(F(x,g(x))=0\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\((x,y) \in V\)</span>.
    Therefore
    <span class="math display">
        \[y&#39; = g&#39;(x)\]
    </span>
    exists; by uniqueness of the derivative, the two derivative functions must be identical. The important thing here is that the representation is differentiable, which justifies seeking a derivative in the first place!</p>
<h3 id="sketch-of-the-proof">Sketch of the Proof</h3>
<p>Implicit function theorem actually follows from another, more “powerful” result, the inverse function theorem.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(A \subset \R^n\)</span> be open and <span class="math inline">\(f:A \to \R^n\)</span> be continuously differentiable with Jacobian <span class="math inline">\(Df\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(x_0 \in A\)</span> satisfy <span class="math inline">\(Jf(x_0) := \text{det}(Df(x_0)) \neq 0\)</span>.
  Then there exists a neighborhood <span class="math inline">\(U \ni x_0\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(U \subset A\)</span> and an open neighborhood <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(f(x_0)\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(f(U)=W\)</span> and the restriction of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> has a continuously differentiable inverse <span class="math inline">\(f^{-1}:W \to U\)</span>.
  Moreover, for any <span class="math inline">\(y \in W\)</span> and corresponding <span class="math inline">\(x=f^{-1}(y)\)</span>, the Jacobian of the inverse <span class="math inline">\(Df^{-1}(y)\)</span> is given by
    <span class="math display">
        \[Df^{-1}(y) = [Df(x)]^{-1}\]
    </span>
</p>
<p>
  Inverse function theorem is actually true in quite general spaces The idea of the proof of the implicit function theorem is to consider a function <span class="math inline">\(F(x,y) = (x,f(x,y))\)</span>; if we want to find <span class="math inline">\(y=g(x)\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(f(x,g(x))=0\)</span>, it is enough to show that <span class="math inline">\(F^{-1}\)</span> exists near some solution of <span class="math inline">\(f(x,y)=0\)</span>.
</p>

<h3 id="future-work">Future Work</h3>
<p>Implicit function theorem can be generalized quite a bit. This will be the topic of a subsequent post if it will be useful. The same could be said of the inverse function theorem.</p>
<p>Plotting packages for implicit equations are based on the implicit function theorem along with other facts and heuristics; it would be interesting to see how far an implicit plotting package could get with <em>just</em> implicit function theorem, in some sense.</p>
