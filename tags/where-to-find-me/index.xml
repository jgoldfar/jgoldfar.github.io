For a blog such as this one, the moderation overhead far outweighed the value that those forms provided.
While I am more interested than ever in your feedback, the comment form hasn&amp;rsquo;t been the best place for good feedback.
Email continues to be the best way to reach out; if you have a topic suggestion, a question, or just want to say &amp;ldquo;hey&amp;rdquo;, I&amp;rsquo;m always available at jgoldfar@gmail.</description></item><item><title>Find me in 2024</title><link>https://jgoldfar.github.io/blog/2023/12/28/20231229-outreach/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Dec 2023 15:00:47 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jgoldfar.github.io/blog/2023/12/28/20231229-outreach/</guid><description>Visitors to this blog may notice that I haven&amp;rsquo;t published much recently here; my recent content strategy has emphasized social media platforms and to a larger extent my internal stakeholders.
Follow the links in the top bar to see what I mean. The real value for me is in direct messages, which you won&amp;rsquo;t see, but if you reach out I&amp;rsquo;ll get back to you.
I am somewhat active on LinkedIn and have great engagement with folks in the industry.</description></item></channel></rss>
