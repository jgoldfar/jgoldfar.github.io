This blog is a place to discuss things learned and ask questions, and the posts that I write are often just starting points for dialogue online or offline.
One of my goals as a communicator is to facilitate simple, clear, and effective dialogue involving complex ideas. Oftentimes, I can&amp;rsquo;t achieve that goal in a blog post - clarity can require interaction between the reader, the subject, and the environment.</description></item></channel></rss>
