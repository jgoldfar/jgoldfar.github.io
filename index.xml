It is a great privilege to have the opportunity to share my knowledge, work with students, and observe the learning process. Observing - carefully and compassionately noticing what a student is doing - is one of the most powerful modalities for education.</description></item><item><title>How To Make Sense of the NodeJS Event Loop</title><link>https://jgoldfar.github.io/blog/2021/06/12/0501-how-to-make-sense-of-nodejs-event-loop/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jun 2021 09:00:47 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jgoldfar.github.io/blog/2021/06/12/0501-how-to-make-sense-of-nodejs-event-loop/</guid><description>When you&amp;rsquo;re writing JavaScript code for NodeJS, you don&amp;rsquo;t often need to think about how your code will be executed. You may be thinking about the models you are working with, how data moves through your application, or what guarantees you need to be able to provide to meet your acceptance criteria - or you may have another framework in mind.
One of the great things about JavaScript on the Node runtime as a developer is that you get to write code at a high level and have your code execute efficiently on hardware.</description></item><item><title>Python + Flask CRUD Application Scaffold</title><link>https://jgoldfar.github.io/blog/2021/06/05/0605-python-flask-crud-application/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jun 2021 09:00:47 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jgoldfar.github.io/blog/2021/06/05/0605-python-flask-crud-application/</guid><description>I have found it useful to prepare boilerplate code for spinning up things like a new application; in this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll share some code for prototyping an application that can create, retrieve, update, and delete records from a database using Flask.
For developers with experience with Django, Flask is familiar but with a smaller footprint, and leaves more up to the application architect when it comes to implementation details like form validation and data persistence.</description></item><item><title>All Finite Things Reveal Infinitude</title><link>https://jgoldfar.github.io/blog/2021/05/31/0102-finite-things-reveal-infinitude/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 May 2021 10:26:50 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jgoldfar.github.io/blog/2021/05/31/0102-finite-things-reveal-infinitude/</guid><description>All finite things reveal infinitude: The mountain with its singular bright shade Like the blue shine on freshly frozen snow, The after-light upon ice-burdened pines; Odor of basswood on a mountain-slope, A scent beloved of bees; Silence of water above a sunken tree : The pure serene of memory in one man, &amp;ndash; A ripple widening from a single stone Winding around the waters of the world.

In my continuous search for better ways to facilitate open and effective communication, I came across the concept of a personal &amp;ldquo;user manual&amp;rdquo;, a living document that encapsulates how I work with others. I can&amp;rsquo;t count the number of times a colleague has told me they avoided a conversation with an office-mate or colleague because they weren&amp;rsquo;t sure how productive the conversation would be.</description></item><item><title>Simple Python Hash Table</title><link>https://jgoldfar.github.io/blog/2021/04/22/0422-python-hashtable/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Apr 2021 09:00:47 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jgoldfar.github.io/blog/2021/04/22/0422-python-hashtable/</guid><description>&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">hash table&lt;/a> or hash map is one of the fundamental data structures in computing.
It is an abstraction that allows a programming language user to think about
their problem at a level that is closer to the specifications developed for
business processes, instead of considering how the associated data is stored.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What? Context</title><link>https://jgoldfar.github.io/blog/2021/03/27/0101-about/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Mar 2021 09:00:47 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jgoldfar.github.io/blog/2021/03/27/0101-about/</guid><description>If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this post, you might be looking for some context around the blog and this section on the site. I have a passion for experimenting with technologies and approaches, with the overall goal of delivering value to the organizations and teams I serve. This blog is a place to work out those experiments, discuss learnings, and ask questions.
One of my goals as a communicator is to facilitate simple, clear, and effective dialogue involving complex ideas.</description></item><item><title>Why Noether Rudin?</title><link>https://jgoldfar.github.io/blog/2020/06/22/0622-why-noether-rudin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jun 2020 10:26:50 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jgoldfar.github.io/blog/2020/06/22/0622-why-noether-rudin/</guid><description>&lt;p>Originally published on blog.noetherrudin.com, then on blog.getdolr.com, this piece summarized my support for an effort to get more money for people&amp;rsquo;s student loans.
I still love developing, sharing, and applying knowledge in service of good causes.

It serves as a mapping between high-order concepts and their simpler counterparts.
Some of the hardest things to get right - both in mind of the student and the teacher - are the correct definitions and concepts. Once you have those, oftentimes statements of fact - like theorems - become easier to form and comprehend. Then, paraphrasing an idea from mathematics, once we have statements of fact, we find the reasoning easily enough.</description></item><item><title>About, Vitae, and Contact</title><link>https://jgoldfar.github.io/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jgoldfar.github.io/contact/</guid><description>I am an experienced technical contributor and project generalist with demonstrated ability to negotiate requirements, resources, and risks.

2016&amp;ndash;Present: Working professionally in domains including Commerce, Defense, Finance, and Medical Data industries in roles from engineering to product management, I have discovered a passion for delivering value to the stakeholders and clients I work with.</description></item><item><title>Collaborative Discovery</title><link>https://jgoldfar.github.io/about/collaboration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jgoldfar.github.io/about/collaboration/</guid><description>I define collaboration as inclusive, results-driven partnerships built around common goals; in my work, I prioritize connection and communication to unlock the insights necessary to increase efficiency and deliver operational benefits. In a rapidly changing environment, the only way to successfully adapt is to accept more opinions, more perspectives, and finally more action - I take a people-first approach to understanding your organization&amp;rsquo;s vision and goals.
For many projects, technology is actually a small but critical component in the processes producing good outcomes; in my experience, a focus on actively listening to stakeholders and domain experts provides a basis for strategic discussions around adapting to changing conditions and progressing towards long-term goals.</description></item><item><title>Contract Services: Working with Me</title><link>https://jgoldfar.github.io/about/services/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jgoldfar.github.io/about/services/</guid><description>I offer professional services in all areas of digital transformation for teams tasked with delivering effectively on business challenges; if you know your outcomes aren&amp;rsquo;t meeting expectations, we can drive their improvement.

But that&amp;rsquo;s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I&amp;rsquo;m actually as proud of the things we haven&amp;rsquo;t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.” &amp;ndash; Steve Jobs
As Jobs observes, there is more to innovation than just collaboration: as much as inclusion of diverse ideas and the facilitation of a vibrant discussion creates a strong starting point for growth, innovation also requires a deliberate focus on executing a positive vision, and evolving in response to changing conditions.</description></item><item><title>Privacy Policy</title><link>https://jgoldfar.github.io/about/privacy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jgoldfar.github.io/about/privacy/</guid><description>PRIVACY NOTICE
