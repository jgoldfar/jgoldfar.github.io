Who hasn&amp;rsquo;t avoided going to an office-mate or boss because they weren&amp;rsquo;t sure how productive the conversation would be? Those kinds of missed opportunities can so easily be avoided with open communication in an organization.</description></item><item><title>FOMO &amp; FOBO</title><link>https://jgoldfar.github.io/glossary/fomo-and-fobo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 May 2021 11:33:47 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jgoldfar.github.io/glossary/fomo-and-fobo/</guid><description>The terms &amp;ldquo;FOMO&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;FOBO&amp;rdquo; are common parlance in some groups - not everyone is familiar with both terms, and how some individuals in roles such as sales use FOMO or FOBO to try to influence prospective buyers. Both are fear-based factors, fundamentally - research in economics seems to suggest that some significant percentage of buyer choice is actually emotional rather than rational, so companies wanting to maximize conversion are bound to use powerful emotions like fear to try to land a sale.</description></item><item><title>Simple Python Hash Table</title><link>https://jgoldfar.github.io/blog/2021/04/22/python-hashtable/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Apr 2021 09:00:47 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jgoldfar.github.io/blog/2021/04/22/python-hashtable/</guid><description>&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">hash table&lt;/a> or hash map is one of the fundamental data structures in computing.
It is an abstraction that allows a programming language user to think about
their problem at a level that is closer to the specifications developed for
business processes, instead of considering how the associated data is stored.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What Is This? Some Context</title><link>https://jgoldfar.github.io/blog/2021/03/27/about/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Mar 2021 09:00:47 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jgoldfar.github.io/blog/2021/03/27/about/</guid><description>This section of my site is a web log, a collection of writings and other combinations of images, text, and media expressed in visual form. I subscribe to the notion that having good ideas is a matter of having lots of ideas and selecting the best among them - ideas are not worth much on their own, but in my experience, there is value in adapting the correct convex combination to challenging problems.</description></item><item><title>Why Noether Rudin?</title><link>https://jgoldfar.github.io/blog/2020/06/22/why-noether-rudin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jun 2020 10:26:50 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jgoldfar.github.io/blog/2020/06/22/why-noether-rudin/</guid><description>&lt;p>Originally published on blog.noetherrudin.com, then on blog.getdolr.com, this piece summarized my support for an effort to get more money for people&amp;rsquo;s student loans.
I still love developing, sharing, and applying knowledge in service of good causes.

It serves as a mapping between high-order concepts and their simpler counterparts.
Some of the hardest things to get right - both in mind of the student and the teacher - are the correct definitions and concepts. Once you have those, oftentimes statements of fact - like theorems - become easier to form and comprehend. Then, paraphrasing an idea from mathematics, once we have statements of fact, we find the reasoning easily enough.</description></item><item><title>About, Vitae, and Contact</title><link>https://jgoldfar.github.io/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jgoldfar.github.io/contact/</guid><description>I am an experienced technical contributor and project generalist with demonstrated ability to negotiate requirements, resources, and risks.

In a rapidly changing environment, the only way to successfully adapt is to accept more opinions, more perspectives, and finally more action - I take a people-first approach to understanding your organization&amp;rsquo;s vision and goals.
For many projects, technology is actually a small but critical component in the processes producing good outcomes; in my experience, a focus on actively listening to stakeholders and domain experts provides a basis for strategic discussions around adapting to changing conditions and progressing towards long-term goals.</description></item><item><title>Freelance and Contract Services</title><link>https://jgoldfar.github.io/about/services/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jgoldfar.github.io/about/services/</guid><description>I offer professional services in all areas of digital transformation; whether you want to differentiate your business or need technical guidance to respond to an organizational disruption, I am prepared to identify solutions and leverage technology to enable your success.

But that&amp;rsquo;s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I&amp;rsquo;m actually as proud of the things we haven&amp;rsquo;t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.” &amp;ndash; Steve Jobs
As Jobs observes, there is more to innovation than just collaboration: as much as inclusion of diverse ideas and the facilitation of a vibrant discussion creates a strong starting point for growth, innovation also requires a deliberate focus on executing a positive vision, and evolving in response to changing conditions.</description></item></channel></rss>
